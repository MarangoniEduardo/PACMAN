# PACMAN
Pac-Man Game
To play the prompt PACMAN or "foge-foge" game you'll need to have GCC compiler, download or create all of this files "except this README".
If you have cloned or downloaded all the files, just run "scrpitff.bat" on windows. If you are on MacOs or Linux, Type in your console 
"gcc fogefoge.c mapa.c ui.c -o fogefoge.out (RETURN)" then type "fogefoge.out (RETURN)", and you are all set, now is just about playing.
Use W,A,S,D (Type enter to validate the movements "W RETURN, s RETURN") to move, and "B" to use the bomb, that is used just like the movement controls. :D
